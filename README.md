# Off-by-One Error in Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays.  The `Bug.java` file contains code that attempts to populate an array, but due to an incorrect loop condition, it goes out of bounds, potentially leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The `BugSolution.java` file presents the corrected code.
